    <h2 class="heading">Project Structure:</h2>
    <p>Note:This project is developed based on new version of angular 17.So, we all know that
        in the latest version we have standalone components i.e, we no need to create modules for
        each component
    </p>
    <h3 class="margin">src Folder:</h3>
    <p class="margin">The src folder serves as the project’s root directory. 
        It is crucial as it contains all the source files and resources required to develop the Angular application. Developers spend most of their time writing and modifying code in the src folder.
        It is a central hub for all the components and other resources that comprise the application.
    </p>
    <h3 class="margin">app Folder</h3>
    <p class="margin">Inside the src folder, the app folder represents the main application module. 
        It holds the core functionality of the Angular application. 
        The app folder contains various components, services, directives, 
        and other resources specific to the application. Developers organize and structure their code within the app folder to build the user interface, implement business logic, and handle data manipulation.
         This is where the majority of the application’s development takes place.
        1.app.component.html : This contains the "router-outlet tag".
        2.app.component.scss:component level css file
